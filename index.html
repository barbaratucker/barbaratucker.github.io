		<div class = "para">8 Gables Ranch is a small farm located approximately 40 miles west of Sacramento, CA and 40 miles East of San Francisco.  Our goal is to breed and raise happy, healthy, people-friendly Nigerian Dwarf goats.  Here on our 5 acre farm we have extremely spoiled goats, approximately 85 laying hens, 2 cats and one dog and many native birds.</div>
		<div class = "para">We chose Nigerian Dwarf goats for our farm because they have the highest butterfat of any dairy goat breed in the USA.  In all honesty that was the second reason.  The first was because they are so adorable. Standard sized goats have butterfat around 3-4%.  Nigerian Dwarfs average 6-10%.  Nigerians give a surprising amount of milk for their small stature.  The high butterfat makes them an excellent choice for those that want to make cheese.</div>
		<div class = "para">All available goats are on our for sale page,  wethers starting at $150 each our does and bucks at $400 and up.  We continue to test and promote a healthy herd, free of CAE and CL disease.  All testing was negative in 2015 and 2016.</div>
		<div class = "para">We are proudly breeding and showing ADGA Registered Nigerian Dwarf dairy goats.  We breed for dairy character, conformation and milk production, color and cuteness is just an added bonus!</div>
		<div class = "para">Our emphasis is on conformation, production and personality.  We have many flashy blue eyed kids.  Some are polled and all others will be disbudded.</div>
		<div class = "para">The gentle nature of the Nigerian Dwarf Goat along with the small stature makes for an easily maintained pet.  There is nothing sweeter than a pet wether (neutered male).  Hand raised, exceptionally sweet disposition, easily managed for their miniature size.  They love people attention.</div>
		<div class = "para">The Nigerian Dwarf Dairy Goat breed is an excellent choice for the family homestead.  They require less water, feed, minerals, shelter and fencing than a standard sized goat but with the same benefits of browsing when placed on rotating pastures.</div>
		<div class = "para">Goat milk is healthy and nutritious.  It is naturally rich in calcium and potassium, as well as Vitamin A.  Goat milk's mild proteins and smaller fat particles make it easier to digest and gentle on the stomach.  Goat milk can be a wonderful alternative for children and adults who are lactose intolerant, allergic to cow or soy milk, or those who suffer from ulcers and stomach ailments.  Cow milk takes about 24 hours to digest and goat's milk takes more like 20 minutes.  It is mild and sweet.  The milk should be chilled immediately after leaving the goat to preserve its natural flavor.</div>
