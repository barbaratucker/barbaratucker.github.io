				<div id ="tab-name">KID RESERVATION POLICY</div>
				<div class = "para">Unborn kids can be reserved with a $100 deposit, accompanied by a letter stating who you are reserving (so we have a paper trail), all contact information.  Reservations will be taken on a first-deposit, first-reserve basis only- NO RESERVATIONS WITH OUT A DEPOSIT- NO EXCEPTIONS- This deposit is non-refundable unless the kid of your choice is not born, at which time you can choose to roll over your deposit to another kidding, or have your deposit refunded. If you realize before the kid is born that you will not be able to purchase the animal, as a courtesy, please let me know that as soon as possible. Your deposit will not be refunded, but it will open up that reservation for someone else.</div>
				<div class = "para">If you see a doe you may be interested in who has kids reserved, contact me and we will put your name on the alternate list to be contacted if a reservation is cancelled.  There is no obligation for our alternate list, but realize you can be bumped down for a deposit.</div>
				<div class = "para">Buck kids out of first fresheners will automatically be wethered (neutered) and available as pets for $150. Wethers make wonderful pets as they don't have the hormonal cycles of does, nor the pungent smell of bucks, and they can be shown in 4-H and at NDGA shows. All kids are disbudded between the ages of 2-14 days. If you would like a goat that will grow up to have horns, I am happy to not disbud them for you- however, since there is a limited market for horned nigerians, these kids must be paid for in full by the time they are five days old, otherwise, I will go ahead and disbud them.</div>
				<div class = "para">All kids born here at 8 Gables are automatically put on bottles- this helps to keep kids friendly.  In order to make sure your kids are friendly, you should bring them home as early as possible to spend extra time with them making them friendly. I spend extra time with the kids I am planning on retaining- I don't have time to make everyone friendly and get all of the other work I need to do done. Reserved kids must be picked up by 21 days of age at the latest- I prefer that they be picked up within one week of birth. Boarding charges of $3 per kid per day will be applied to those still at the farm after 21 days of age; reservations on bottle raised wethers may be forfeited at this time at my discretion, and the kid(s) offered for sale. Reserved kids still at the farm at eight weeks of age will no longer be considered reserved and will be offered for sale as well. Non-reserved kids will be held for two weeks from the date that purchaser tells me that they want that animal to arrange for transport; after that time, boarding charges of $3 per day per kid will be applied. All kids must be paid for in full before they leave the farm, and all transportation costs are the responsibility of the purchaser. </div>
				<div class = "para">Genetics are not a perfect science and so although I strive to produce quality goats, only to better the breed, I can't guarantee any genetic trait of kids or how they mature.  Much goes into producing greatb dairy goats including how they are raised to maturity.  Not every combination turns out the way we plan- i.e. the combination of two fabulous animals can sometimes still result in a pet-quality animal. If this happens, the price for such an animal will be adjusted accordingly. Bucks and does will be priced the same, as we will only sell bucks from top quality mothers. </div>
				<div class = "para">Due to health concerns kids cannot be returned once they leave the farm.  I have too much invested to risk bringing in any new "bugs" from another herd.  (No one has ever asked to return one of my babies so far).</div>
				<div class = "para">Kids leave my herd in good health so any illness incurred after arrival in their new home is the responsibility of the new owners.  There are no goats here with CAE, CL, Johnes.</div>
