<div class = "para">We maintain a closed herd. We maintain the right to keep any kid at any time. All available goats are on our for sale page, wethers starting at $150, but if purchasing two or more wethers they will be discounted to $100 each.  <b>(Wethers picked up by 14 days of age will be $110 each. At 15 days of age to eight weeks of age, they will be they will be $125 each. At eight weeks of age, they will be $150 each to reflect the increased time and expense in raising them ourselves until weaning)</b>. Our does and bucks start at $400 and up.  Prices are subject to change at any time  We continue to test and promote a healthy herd, free of CAE and CL disease.  All testing was negative in 2015.  Prices quoted are for animals picked up at our farm and paid for by check (payable to Barbara Tucker), money order, cash or PayPal.  If PayPal is used, add 3% to the purchase price for the PayPal fees.  Please call us before a PayPal payment is made.</div> 
<div class = "para">The buyer is responsible for payment of the following:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Cost of any extra blood tests that your state may require</li>
	<li>Shipping and transportation costs</li>
	<li>Kennels (We recommend having them shipped directly here from Petsmart or Jeffers.)</li>
	<li>Health certificate and vet check</li>
	<li>Boarding fees when applicable</li>
	<li>ADGA registration or transfer fees</li>
</ul>
<div class = "para">A $100 non-refundable deposit will secure the reservation of your future breeding choice or an animal already born. <b>Our quality stock sells quickly and we recommend placing a reservation for the goat or breeding of your choice.</b> We recommend that you make several choices if you are reserving unborn kids.. If the kid of your choice is not born we will either apply your deposit to another kid at your request or you can wait for the next breeding. Your deposit will last 2 years, or by arrangement according to your specific circumstance. Kids reserved must be picked up within 3 weeks of being born or placing a deposit.  After the 3 weeks are up a $3 per day boarding charge will be applied.  When your kid is born full payment in expected within 7 days.  Sales are not final until the buyer has paid in full.  <b>8 Gables</b> reserves the right to retain any reserved animal for any reason at any time until animal is paid in full. If this is done, payments will be refunded. All animals must be paid for in full before leaving.  At our discretion, reserved kids who have not been paid for, in full, by 8 weeks old will no longer be considered reserved and may be offered for sale as well. We will make every attempt to work out an arrangement prior to taking this step. If a client changes their mind or cannot pick the goat up for whatever reason, the deposit is <b>Not Refundable and not banked</b> to use toward another sale years later.</div>
<div class = "para">If an animal is posted as being "exposed" to a buck we do not guarantee that animal is pregnant.  Exposed just means that doe has been in with a buck for a period of time and should be pregnant.  We also do not guarantee the quantity of does or bucks.  There will be no refund  for a doe that aborts or the kids  do not live.</div>
<div class = "para">All kids will be on their dam for 3-5 days, then bottle fed for a minimum of 8 weeks.  All will be disbudded between 2-14 days old unless they are polled.  All kids will be tattooed, given CD&T vaccinations, BoSe and coccidia preventive treatment.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats are very social creatures and accordingly, they must go to a pet or dairy home with existing goats.  If you do not already own goats you can purchase two or more.  No less than two in a home.  All does and intact bucks will be  ADGA registered.</div>
<div class = "para">Refer to the Kidding Schedule for anticipated breedings or upcoming kidding.</div>
<div class = "para">We sell animals that are healthy and sound at the time of transfer. We cannot guarantee that they will mature as you or we would expect. We cannot guarantee their mature conformation, stature, udder attachment, show ability, quality of their offspring, etc. There are many factors involved in the development of an animal including life-long management (feeding, health care maintenance, parasite control, housing, breeding, stress, etc). We cannot take responsibility for how a kid you purchase from us ultimately matures.</div>
<div class = "para">We do not guarantee that a purchaser will like an animal they purchase from us. An animal represents a genetic package. We are not under obligation to take any animal back once it has left the property.</div>
<div class = "para">If a buyer wants to see an animal before purchase, that's wonderful. We encourage people to visit the farm and choose the animal for themselves. For long-distance purchases we will do our best to realistically represent the animal with photos and descriptions. All sales are final.</div>

<div class = "para"><b>Discounts & Deals:</b> A 10% discount for  4H & FFA students is available, contact me for pricing. Also a 10% discount for multiple purchases.  Multiple is constituted by 3 or more (not 2).  We offer a single complementary stud service for does. Any does purchased from us can be bred 1 time for free, provided they test negative for CAE and CL.  The resulting kids will carry the 8 Gables herd name. </div>

<div class = "para"><b>Bottle Feeding & Bonding:</b> After making sure everyone is healthy & fed, we spend a great deal of time handling the kids, to ensure they are friendly and cuddly. They will be weaned no earlier than 8 weeks and can go home at as early as 1 week old, as bottle babies. We recommend you pick up your kids as early as possible to build the best bond you can. We are happy to sell milk to you for your bottle babies or other pets. If you are new to goats, and don't think you have time to bottle feed a kid 3 times a day, it's likely you do not have enough time to raise goats. Bottle feeding is the least time consuming part of their care, and frankly, one of the more fun things to do at that age.</div>
<div class = "para"><b>Show & Performance Homes:</b> If you participate in linear appraisals, milk tests or shows, we will show our appreciation in several ways.  Any doe with our herd name that earns a milk star or is appraised two years in a row will receive $50. ADGA finished champions with our herd name will receive $100.</div>
<div class = "para"><b>Right of Refusal:</b> We know life is full of unexpected events. No judgment will be passed and our feelings will not be hurt. If you decide to sell or re-home a goat you have purchased from us, we want first right of refusal. We will either purchase the goat or help you find a good home.</div>
<div class = "para"><b>Building A Herd</b></div>
<div class = "para">Ideally, everyone would purchase a full grown animal with mature offspring to judge from. This is rarely, if ever, possible. Though we breed our goats for the best progeny, not all animals meet our expectations. Sometimes this is obvious at an early age and the animal can be culled. However, sometimes it becomes apparent as the animal matures, or only when the animal's offspring are born and mature. Goat breeding is partly a crap shoot: there are no guarantees. The younger an animal is when purchased, the more uncertainty accompanies it. We are selling genetic potential. The animals we sell represent more than the animal you purchase. That goat represents the combination of genes from our herd which you are choosing to ad to your herd. There is no telling how these genes will blend with yours. Occasionally we sell mature animals, bucks or does, after they have produced offspring. Obviously this is the most risk-free purchase…but still, there is no way to predict how these genes will blend with their chosen mates. Every breeding is a gamble. Sometimes genes from two outstanding lines do not blend favorably. This is a chance you take.</div>
<div class = "para">In addition, building a herd type takes time. First fresheners may show beautiful udders that stay that way, but only time will tell if they stay that way. Sometimes a doe takes time to blossom, and discarding her at a young age may be premature. Goats take several years to mature, so patience is often the best tool when making breeding decisions. Ultimately, the proof of any buck is a number (at least 1/2 dozen) of his daughters (out of different dams) when they are mature, with udders full of milk. The prettiest buck can be totally worthless if his daughters do not turn out well.</div>
<div class = "para">If we sell breeding stock that proves to be infertile (backed up with a Vet or AI collector's detailed report for verification) we may feel an obligation to replace it with our choice of something comparable, depending on availability. We will require the infertile animal's certificate of registration to be turned over to us for the replacement.</div>
<div class = "para"><b>Right to Veterinary Examination</b></div>
<div class = "para">A purchaser has the right to a full veterinary examination at his/her expense on any animals to be purchased. We are not responsible for the health of any animal purchased from us beyond 24 hours from the time it leaves the farm, under most circumstances. Should we be presented with a Vet’s official statement that the animal in question had a congenital, or another underlying condition prior to transfer, we will do what we can to reach a satisfactory outcome for all parties. We will not claim responsibility for illness, damage or death as a result of shipping. Accidents happen.</div>
<div class = "para">BUCKLINGS: Buck quality bucklings will be offered for sale for a very limited period of time. If they are not sold by 14 days after kidding they will be wethered. No bucklings will be available from first fresheners.</div>

<div class = "para">HEALTH: See guarantee at the bottom of the page.</div>

<div class = "para">SHIPPING: Shipping is available. However, it is expensive. Costs include the crate, veterinarian fee and health certificate, airfare, and mileage to the airport.</div>

<div class = "para"><b>Disease-Free Guarantee:</b></div>
<div class = "para">I use multiple measures to ensure that my goats are disease free:</div>
<ul>
<li>I only buy from reputable herds that maintain strong bio-security.</li>
<li>New goats are subject to quarantine</li>
<li>During quarantine, new adult goats are tested for CAE and CL</li>
<li>Starting in 2015, all new goats were tested for CAE, CL, and Johnes while in quarantine</li>
<li>All herd animals over 1 year of age are tested annually for CAE (CL is ruled out through testing of new goats)</li>
<li>Bucks that are offered for stud are bred only to does with recent certification (within 30 days) of negative test results for CAE, CL, and Johnes.</li>
<li>Bucks that are offered for stud are tested for CAE, CL, and Johnes after the breeding season.</li>
<li>Goats that visit the farm for purposes of Linear Appraisal and Milk Test Competition will be housed in areas that are physically remote from the 8 Gables herd. Those goats will be required to have veterinary certification of negative CAE and CL results.</li>
</ul>
<div class = "para">Animals purchased from <b>8 Gables</b> are guaranteed to be disease-free. <b>However,</b> that guarantee is only valid as long as the goat is on the property. The reason for this is that once the goat leaves the property in the possession of the buyer I cannot guarantee that the goat will not be exposed to other goats who carry disease.</div>
<div class = "para">Buyers have the right to request that a veterinarian examine and test a goat that they intend to purchase. However, that examination and testing is at the buyer's expense.</div>
