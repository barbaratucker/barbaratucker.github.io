<div class = "para"><center>If you would like to make a purchase, please fill out the <a href="contract.pdf" target="_blank"><b><u>Downloadable Contract</u></b></a></center></div><hr>
<div class = "para">See our for sale page or kidding schedule for available goats. Wethers starting at $200, our does and bucks start at $500 and up.  Prices are subject to change at any time.   We continue to test and promote a healthy herd, free of CAE and CL disease.  All testing has been negative.  Prices quoted are for animals picked up at our farm and paid for by check (payable to Barbara Tucker), money order, cash or Zelle.</div>
<div class = "para">A $100 non-refundable deposit will secure the reservation of your future breeding choice or an animal already born. We recommend that you make several choices if you are reserving unborn kids. If the kid of your choice is not born we will either apply your deposit to another kid at your request or you can wait for the next breeding. Your deposit will last 2 years. Kids reserved must be picked up within 14 days of being born or placing a deposit.  After the 14 days are up a $5 per day boarding charge will be applied.  When your kid is born full payment in expected within 7 days.  Sales are not final until the buyer has paid in full.  All animals must be paid for in full before leaving.  Reserved kids who have not been paid for, in full, by 8 weeks old will no longer be considered reserved and may be offered for sale. If you change your mind or cannot pick the goat up for whatever reason, the deposit is Not Refundable and not banked to use toward another sale years later.</div>
<div class = "para">All kids will be on their dam for 3-7 days, then bottle fed for a minimum of 8 weeks.  All will be disbudded between 2-14 days old unless they are polled.  All kids will be tattooed, given CD&T vaccinations and BoSe.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats are herd animals, and cannot thrive alone. They must always have another goat as a companion. Other herd animals can be substituted such as a calf, horse, or lamb, but two goats are always better than one. If you do not already own a goat you can purchase two or more.</div>
<div class = "para">All does and intact bucks will be ADGA registered.</div>
<div class = "para">Refer to the <a href="kidding.html">Kidding Schedule for anticipated breedings or upcoming kidding.</a></div>
<div class = "para">We do not guarantee that a purchaser will like an animal they purchase from us. We are not under obligation to take any animal back once it has left the property.</div>
<div class = "para"><b>8 Gables</b> reserves the right to retain any reserved animal for any reason at any time until animal is paid in full.  If this is done, any deposit or payments will be refunded.</div>
<div class = "para">We spend a great deal of time handling the kids, to ensure they are friendly and cuddly. Kids will be weaned no earlier than 8 weeks and can go home at as early as 1 week old, as bottle babies. The earlier you pick up your kids the greater bond you can build. We are happy to sell milk to you for your bottle babies or other pets.</div>
<div class = "para">Goat breeding is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you are going to get. There are no guarantees. This is a chance you take.</div>

<div class = "para">Shipping is available. However, it is expensive. Costs are buyers responsibility.</div><br>
<div class = "para"><b>Disease-Free Guarantee: </b></div>
<div class = "para">We sell animals that are healthy and sound at the time of transfer. We do everything we can to ensure that our goats are disease free.  I only buy from reputable herds. New goats are subject to quarantine. During quarantine, new adult goats are tested for CAE and CL.  All herd animals over 1 year of age are tested annually for CAE, CL and Johnnes.  Bucks that are offered for stud are bred only to does with recent certification (within 30 days) of negative test results for CAE, CL, and Johnnes. </div>
<div class = "para">Goats that visit the farm for purposes of Linear Appraisal will be housed in areas that are physically remote from the 8 Gables herd. Those goats will be required to have certification of negative CAE and CL results.</div>
<div class = "para">Animals purchased from <b>8 Gables</b> are guaranteed to be disease-free. However, that guarantee is only valid as long as the goat is on the property. The reason for this is that once the goat leaves the property in the possession of the buyer we cannot guarantee that the goat will not be exposed to other goats who carry disease</div>

<div class = "para">Buyers have the right to request that a veterinarian examine and test a goat that they intend to purchase. However, that examination and testing is at the buyer's expense.</div>
<div class = "para">All sales are final.</div>
