<div class = "para">The Nigerian Dwarf is considered to be a dairy goat in miniature, and to have the graceful, refined, proportions of the dairy goat at about 1/3 the size: Maximum height at the withers (high point of shoulder) for does: 22 1/2", bucks: 23 1/2".  These goats are popular as hobby goats due to their easy maintenance and small stature. Their small stature means they do not require as much space as their larger dairy goat counterparts and their gentle and friendly personalities make them good companion pets. They are easy to handle; even small children can be at ease with these little goats.</div>
<div class = "para">The average life span of a Buck is around 8 years but up to 12 years; the average for a Doe is around 11-12 years and up to 20 years.</div>
<div class = "para">A healthy Nigerian Dwarf doe can produce a surprising amount of sweet milk for her small size - up to two quarts per day. In addition, Nigerian Dwarf milk is higher in butterfat (6-10%) and higher in protein than milk from most dairy goat breeds, making Nigerian Dwarf goat milk excellent for cheese and soap making. However, many Nigerian Dwarf owners do not raise their goats for milk but for the pleasure and companionship these little caprines bring to their lives. Females are called does; males are called bucks and offspring are called kids. Neutered males make great pets and are called wethers.</div>
<div class = "para">The care of your Nigerian is similar to the care of other goats. Good management (selection, nutrition, parasite control, health care, housing and responsible breeding) is the foundation of your herd and this will determine the ultimate condition and confirmation of your stock. Goats are herd animals, so they depend on the companionship of other goats. They must always have another goat as a companion. They form a life-long friendship with their companions, and will mourn for their companion if separated. A wether can be used as a companion for a doe or a buck. Other herd animals can be substituted such as a calf, horse, or lamb, but two goats are always better than one. </div>
<div class = "para">They also like and need lots of love and attention. Due to their gentle, lovable personalities, most Nigerian Dwarf owners breed their goats for the companionship and pleasure these little guys offer.  Goats are sensitive, intelligent animals. They love attention, especially from young children. Goats are born wild, not tame. To tame a goat, it helps to be present at the birth, so that the goats can imprint on humans. If the kids are not bottle-raised, and tame goats are preferred, then they need to be handled frequently each day until they are tame. Taming a goat makes a life-long friend.</div>
<div class = "para">For their housing you must provide a barn, shed, or a large dog house so they can get out of rain, snow, wind and sun. You must provide a sturdy fence; the BEST fencing is four foot high by 16 foot long graduated livestock panels or "poultry/rabbit" fence with wrapped rather than welded corners is ideal and will last. As you think about fencing, remember that your goal is twofold: to keep your goats where you want them, and to protect them from dogs and coyotes who are their greatest threat. Never trust a dog or dogs with your goats! Dogs are predators-goats are prey.  ! Many owners find that providing a few "toys" for the goats provide them with hours of caprine entertainment. Tree stumps, rocks or large cable spools are great for "king of the mountain" games and jumping. Just be sure to keep them away from the fence to avoid giving herd escape artists means to roam your neighborhood! They have a good memory and know all the escape spots, so be vigilant.</div>
<div class = "para">The feeding requirements of your goats depends on their age and gender. As ruminants, they depend on a diet primarily of hay. Sweet smelling, non dusty, second cut grass or grass/legume hay is ideal for all and should be fed free choice.  The main thing is to make sure they have free choice browsing and/or hay and clean fresh water. Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a day and still have perfectly healthy goats. You will have to decide what is practical for your animal and your schedule. Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be soiled by the goat. When milking, a combination mixture of feed is suggested. We let the does in milk eat their fill while on the milk stand. Also, the pregnant and young does get some feed as well. The feed mixture is debatable. Some give their goats only soaked oats or grains while on the milk stand, while others feed a mixture of alfalfa pellets, goat feed, black oil sunflower, and a 14% all natural horse feed. There are several books and web sites that have feeding suggestions. Goats are browsers, not grazers. They will browse on plants such as ivy, blackberries, honeysuckle, and they love fallen, dry leaves. Weeds, leaves from trees, underbrush, and poison ivy are also favorites.And goats love treats!! Fresh cut apples, carrots or  horse treats are favorite treats. Our kids love animal cookies.</div>
<div class = "para">Males are prone to developing kidney/urinary tract stones (calculi) so they should be maintained on a low protein, low calcium diet. A mineral balance achieved with a goat-formula mineral supplement aids in the prevention of urinary calculi. I recommend feeding males limited grain once they are over 6 months to one year of age, augmented with a goat-formulated mineral supplement. Avoiding high protein feed supplements significantly reduces the risk of developing urinary calculi (blockage). You can give your wether or buck a vegetable or fruit treat while the girls get their grain. (If you insist on feeding grain to (mature) males, use a “Lamb Finisher” pellet. These contain a urine acidifier, ammonium chloride, which helps prevent calculi and is the grain of choice; not more than 1/8-1/4 cup per day). If you've had a problem with UC you might try adding extra urine acidifiers.</div>
<div class = "para">Does benefit from alfalfa and/or increased grain -16 or 18% protein goat feed when pregnant or lactating. Mature non-breeding, animals may be maintained on a good quality hay alone. Kids are growing and benefit from a high protein diet. I strongly recommend feeding kids a starter pellet medicated with a coccidiastat for their first 6 months. It is also a good idea to have your vet check the stool for coccidia and other parasites regularly when your goats are young and annually when mature.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats enjoy a variety of extras: a salt block, fruit and vegetable scraps, baked goods in moderation, tree prunings (apple, pine, spruce, maple). Be careful to avoid mold! Goats are very susceptible to mold toxins. Avoid toxic plants!: Rhododendron, azalea, Lantana, yew(looks like spruce but no scent), laurel, cherry - these can kill in very small doses. Never change the diet suddenly, always introduce new or extras in small quantities. If your goat over eats (gorges on grain) that which it is not accustomed, watch it carefully for signs of illness and be prepared to call the vet.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats need fresh water at all times.  . Goats prefer clean water, and will refuse soiled water. Lactating goats need lots of fresh water. Keep the water and feed dishes clean by washing with vinegar frequently. Apple cider vinegar can be added to the water. In the winter, and after giving birth, goats like warm water with a little molasses added to it.  Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without water. In some areas of the country, it is important to make sure the water doesn't freeze.</div>
<div class = "para">A mineral supplement formulated for goats should be provided.  I choose Sweetlix Loose Minerals.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats need to be immunized annually for: C/D Tetanus and receive a Selenium injection if living in a deficient area. For the best of health, you should consult your veterinarian. Vaccinations need to be given on a regular schedule. If the dam had a CD/T (clostridium perfringens C and D type/tetanus) one month before giving birth, the kids will gain immunity through her colostrum to tetanus and to enterotoxaemia (a fatal disease that the clostridium perfringerns vaccine prevents). The immunity will last for the first 8 weeks of the kids' lives. If the dam didn't have a vaccination, then it is necessary to give the kids a tetanus shot before disbudding or wethering. Vaccinate the kids at 5 weeks, and 8 weeks if the dam was vaccinated. If she wasn't vaccinated, then give those kids a third vaccination at 12 weeks. Vaccinate on an annual basis after the initial shots.</div>
<div class = "para">Hooves must be trimmed as needed: the bottom should be flat without edges curling under.</div>
<div class = "para">Goats can be born with or without horns (polled).  Disbudding is a common term for horns being removed at a young age.  </div>
<div class = "para">Goats are sociable, playful creatures. They enjoy gentle attention; do not play aggressively with them or they will become aggressive (if you rub their head playing butting games they will but you unpredictably). They especially enjoy a neck or chest rub. They enjoy climbing and jumping on rocks, stumps, and platforms made for their pleasure (and your entertainment).</div>
<div class = "para">When you bring your goat home, expect that it will be frightened and nervous until it gets used to it's new home. It will probably be a bit noisy, may act shy, and will need TLC and reassurance that it's new home is a safe, comfortable, happy place. It usually takes about a week to settle in. Don't chase your goat, let him/her come to you.</div>
<div class = "para">The 8 Gables herd is tested annually for Caprine Arthritic Encephalitis (CAE) and Johnnes Disease): they are consistently negative. They do not have contagious abscesses (Caseous Lymphadenitis). These are the three most serious, deadly, contagious goat diseases. Beware of these when adding new goats (or other ruminants) to your herd.</div>
<div class = "para">A healthy goat appears contented, alert, has an appetite and chews its cud. Its coat is smooth and glossy, skin is clean and pliable. One can feel the ribs under the skin but bones do not appear to jut out. The manure consists of formed, slightly moist pellets which, with the urine should be passed without effort. The normal body temperature of a goat is 102-103F. The normal pulse is 70-80/minute.</div>
<div class = "para">Dwarf goats breed year round, unlike other breeds of goats. Many owners breed their does three times in two years, giving the doe at least a 6-month break. Of course, this is a personal choice for each breeder. The gestation period (or length of pregnancy) for a doe is 145 to 153 days. For the most part, Nigerian Dwarfs are a hearty breed with few kidding problems. New babies average about 2 pounds at birth but grow quickly. Watch out for those little bucks! Bucklings can be fertile at as young as 7 weeks of age. Make sure you wean does and bucks separately to help you avoid unintentional breeding.</div>
<div class = "para">Does can be bred at 7-8 months of age if they have reached a mature size. Some breeders prefer to wait until they are at least 1 year or older. Puberty is from 4 to 12 months (females between 7-10 months and males 4 to 8 months). The natural life expectancy for goats is around 8 to 12 years and in some cases, goats can live over 15 years. Dwarf does can have several kids at a time, 3 and 4 being common with some quintuplet births occurring. Dwarfs are generally good mothers able to take care of their babies should you leave them to do the raising of the kids. (Colostrum is produced in the first milk of the doe and it contains high levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies), vitamin A, minerals, fat and energy. Newborn kids must ingest colostrum within the first 24 hours of life to help protect them against diseases. Healthy kids can stand within minutes after birth and are able to move with the herd almost immediately.) They can also provide a surprising amount of milk for their size if you decide you want your own delicious goat milk or cheese.</div>
<div class = "para">Bucks are able to be used for service by the time they are 7 or 8 months old. Dwarf bucks are vigorous breeders but are gentle enough to be used for hand breeding (contained) or pasture breeding where one buck is available for several does as they come into estrus. Both methods are used successfully. Estrus (or heat) cycle is generally from 18 to 23 days, with length of each heat 12 to 36 hours.</div>
<div class = "para">If you want your goat to nurse her babies and she is refusing, it's worth sticking with it for a few days as long as the kids are getting some milk. Put the mama and her babies in a stall together for a few days. Try to help the babies nurse while the mom is distracted with eating. If she can look back and sniff the babies without kicking them off, that's good, but even if she gets away from them once she is done eating, the oxytocin released into her system every time she nurses will help her feel more motherly. Think frequency over duration.  Five or six times a day to hold the dam and let the babies get a drink, either giving her some food, or holding her collar to get her to stand still. Always be calm and friendly, never violent or pushy (even when feeling frustrated—and it is VERY frustrating).  Make sure the babies are getting enough milk to not get dehydrated (if you let them suck on your finger, their mouth should feel hot and wet) so keep close eye on that. If you don't think the babies are getting enough, milk the mom and give the milk to the babies in a bottle, supplementing what they are getting from the teat, but I wouldn't give up on the nursing right away, either. The babies help with all of this by being really, really persistent. They don't give up. By keeping the babies and mama in a stall together, the babies have a continual opportunity to try to wear mama's defensiveness down. If they can hang in there for a few days, chances are, mom, with her increasing oxytocin levels, will come around.</div>
<div class = "para">Still, there are times when the mother just WON'T. Bottle feeding is a blessing then, because you don’t have to lose the kids! Bottle feeding can be tricky to get started-they don't know what the heck this rubbery thing is you are trying to shove in their mouths, but if they're hungry, and they will be, they'll figure it out. </div>
<div class = "para">It is essential that the newborn kids drink their mother's colostrum the first 24 hours. If for some reason, it doesn't nurse within an hour after birth or if the mother rejects the kid, then the colostrum needs to be milked out, and the baby needs to be bottle-fed the colostrum. At this age, they will only drink about an ounce at a time. They need to be fed at least three times a day for the first 2 weeks. If the kid is too weak to nurse, then it will need to be tube fed. Expect them to eat around 6-8 oz. 3 times a day until they are 8-12 weeks old. A common term includes weaned (a kid that no longer nurses).</div>
<div class = "para">Bottom line, it's worth hanging in there for a few days. Goat mamas often come around. Stay calm and sweet with her at all times. Be gentle but persistent. And just keep helping those babies get a drink.
Nigerian Dwarf (ND) goat ownership is growing faster than any other dairy breed in the US because they make such great additions to the homestead - regardless of whether the homestead is large, small, rural, urban, or suburban. Here are the top five reasons why:</div>
<div class = "para">A Nigerian Dwarf doe will produce an average of 800 lbs. (about 95 gallons) of fresh milk per year. And, they produce milk that has an average butterfat content that's higher than any other dairy goat breed (from 6 - 10%), making the milk taste milder, sweeter, and creamier. Everyone loves ND milk once they taste it! This means that 2 or 3 ND does can supply enough milk for an average family for a year, and because of their size, keeping 2 or 3 does is often possible. For many families, it's more practical to own a couple of small goats that produce a small and consistent amount of milk, rather than one large cow that produces a lot.</div>
<div class = "para">ND's are similar to a medium dog in size, and are fine-boned proportionately small dairy goats (not the stockier Pygmy goats).  They stand approximately 21" high and weigh about 75 lbs. when fully grown.  Given their small size, two can live in about 20 sq. ft. if they also have access to outside pasture space. This makes them feasible for rural, suburban, and even urban settings - some cities have begun allowing ND does.  ND housing does need to be well fenced as they tend to be escape experts.</div>
<div class = "para">Their small size makes them easy to handle even for women and children, and they make excellent 4H projects for kids. They are very affectionate, enjoy attention, and form bonds with both their herd and people. Each goat has a distinct personality, and when socialized frequently form birth on, are quite easy to manage. They tend to act more like dogs than livestock, and it's easier to convince friends or neighbors to farm sit for a few ND's as opposed to larger livestock.</div>
<div class = "para">From an efficiency standpoint, goats convert their food into milk more efficiently than cows or sheep, and among the dairy goat types, ND's convert their food more efficiently than any other dairy goat breed. And goats like to browse rather than graze like cow or sheep, so traditional pastures aren't required. ND's can be turned loose in "wooded" pasture areas where they'll help control poison ivy, blackberries, etc. - all those things we consider nasty weeds they think are tasty. It also takes a lot less room to store hay and feed for a couple of ND's as opposed to larger livestock.</div>
<div class = "para">For those wanting wonderful tasting, hormone and antibiotic free milk, and animals that are easy to handle, feed, and house; ND's are increasingly the answer. Goat's milk is naturally homogenized and it can be digested in less than 20 minutes where as cow's milk can take almost all day.  Goat milk ph is alkaline, while cow milk ph is acid. The fact that they're lovable and adorable too doesn't hurt.</div>
